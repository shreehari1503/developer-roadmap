# What is Cloud Computing?

loud computing refers to applications and services that run on a distributed network using virtualized resources and accessed by common Internet protocols and networking standards. It is distinguished
by the notion that resources are virtual and limitless and that details of the
physical systems on which software runs are abstracted from the user.
In an effort to better describe cloud computing, a number of cloud types
have been defined. In this chapter, you learn about two different classes of
clouds: those based on the deployment model and those based on the service
model. The deployment model tells you where the cloud is located and for
what purpose. Public, private, community, and hybrid clouds are deployment models.
Service models describe the type of service that the service provider is offering. The best-known service models are Software as a Service, Platform as a
Service, and Infrastructure as a Service—the SPI model. The service models
build on one another and define what a vendor must manage and what the
client’s responsibility is.

Cloud computing takes the technology, services, and applications that are similar to those on the
Internet and turns them into a self-service utility. The use of the word “cloud” makes reference to
the two essential concepts:
l Abstraction: Cloud computing abstracts the details of system implementation from users
and developers. Applications run on physical systems that aren’t specified, data is stored
in locations that are unknown, administration of systems is outsourced to others, and
access by users is ubiquitous.
l Virtualization: Cloud computing virtualizes systems by pooling and sharing resources.
Systems and storage can be provisioned as needed from a centralized infrastructure, costs
are assessed on a metered basis, multi-tenancy is enabled, and resources are scalable with
agility
